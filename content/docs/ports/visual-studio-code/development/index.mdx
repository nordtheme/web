This page documents how to develop the theme extension â€” from requirements to VSIX packaging and the development workflow steps.

# Requirements

Download and install Visual Studio Code, or [Visual Studio Code Insiders][vscode-insiders] to update to the latest development state each day, with a minimal version of [1.12.0 or higher][vscode-docs-rl-1.12.0].

# Setup

<Banner
  title={
    <>
      Uninstall all currently installed versions of the <em>Nord</em> extension!
    </>
  }
  variant="warn"
>
  Otherwise the installed and versioned extension will collide with the development extension that'll be configured in this guide.
</Banner>

## Download

Clone the [_Nord Visual Studio Code_ repository from GitHub][gh-repo] to your [local extension directory][vscode-docs-extdir] where name of _Nord_'s extension directory must follow VS Code's extension naming scheme of `<PUBLISHER_NAME>.<EXTENSION_NAME>-<EXTENSION_VERSION>`.

This results in the following directory name for the _Nord_ extension: `arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code-0.0.0`. Note that **you can specify any version number you like**, but using `0.0.0` indicates that this is a special version for development purposes.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nordtheme/visual-studio-code.git arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code-0.0.0
```

To get the project without [Git][] download the project as `.zip` archive file from the GitHub repository or click on the download button below. Afterwards extract the archive to your local extension directory following the directory naming scheme like described above.

<Button href="https://github.com/nordtheme/visual-studio-code/archive/develop.zip">Download</Button>

<Image alt="Screenshot showing the GitHub repository web UI to download the project repository" fillSize={60} fluid={props.images["github-clone.png"]}>
  Download the project repository from GitHub
</Image>

Both methods will use the `develop` branch to work with the latest development state.

Open the extension by [adding the cloned/extracted repository directory to your workspace][vscode-docs-add-to-workspace] or opening the directory directly and set _Nord_ as active color theme like documented in the <Link to={`${ROUTE_DOCS_PORTS_VISUAL_STUDIO_CODE_INSTALLATION}#activation`}>installation & activation guide</Link>.

# Workflow

In contrast to the immediately applied changes when editing the [user settings][vscode-docs-settings] it requires a complete restart/reload of VS Code when editing any [JSON theme files][gh-tree-themes] provided by the extension.

To simplify the development without requiring to restart VS Code every time to preview changes

1. add the [modified workbench UI or syntax theme key][vscode-docs-colortheme-custom] to your user settings
2. save the file to apply the changes immediately
3. add the changes to _Nord_'s JSON theme file afterwards

This way allows to develop and preview the theme without being slowed down by the missing _hot reload_ functionality.

# Packaging

Visual Studio Code extensions are [packaged using the custom and installable VSIX format][vscode-docs-ext-vsixpack].
To package, publish and manage extensions, VS Code uses the official CLI tool [`vsce`][vscode-docs-ext-vsixpack].

1. Follow the official documentations to learn how to [install and use the `vsce` CLI tool][vscode-docs-ext-vsce-install].
2. Run `vsce package` in your terminal from within _Nord Visual Studio Code_'s repository to build the `.vsix` extension file.

Please read the theme documentation about <Link to={`${ROUTE_DOCS_PORTS_VISUAL_STUDIO_CODE_INSTALLATION}#local-installation`}>how to install and activate the generated VSIX file locally</Link>.

Follow the <Link to={ROUTE_DOCS_PORTS_VISUAL_STUDIO_CODE_INSTALLATION}>Installation & Activation Guide</Link> for more details how to enable the theme.
