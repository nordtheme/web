This page documents how to develop the theme package — from requirements to `.sublime-package` packaging and the development workflow steps.

# Requirements

Download and install [Sublime Text] with a minimal version of [3.1.0 Build 3170][sbt-blog-announce-v3.1] (2018-05-07).

# Setup

## Download

Clone the [_Nord Sublime Text_ repository from GitHub][gh-repo] to your [local `Packages/User` directory][sbt-docs-pkgs] located in the [settings data path][sbt-docs-settings].

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-sublime-text.git
```

<Banner title={<>Package directories take precedence over <Code>`.sublime-package`</Code> files!</>} variant="warn">

When Nord has also been installed as `.sublime-package` [ZIP][wiki-zip] archive file while a directory with the same name (without `.sublime-package` prefix) is also placed in the package directory, each file within the directory overrides files whose names are equal to files in the packaged theme. See the section about „Overriding Files From a Zipped Package“ in the [official package documentations][sbt-docs-pkgs].

</Banner>

To get the theme without [Git][], download the repository as [ZIP][wiki-zip] archive file from the GitHub or click on the download button below.

<Button href="https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-sublime-text/archive/develop.zip">Download</Button>

Afterwards extract the archive to your [local `Packages/User` directory][sbt-docs-pkgs] located in the [settings data path][sbt-docs-settings].

Both methods will use the `develop` branch to work with the latest development state.

# Workflow

Sublime Text provides auto reload („hot reload“) for themes to immediately see saved changes when editing any of the package's source code files.

Open the extension by adding the cloned/extracted repository directory as project folder through the „Project: Add Folder“ command or opening the directory directly (_File_ ➜ _Open Folder_) and set _Nord_ as active color theme like documented in the <Link to={`${ROUTE_DOCS_PORTS_SUBLIME_TEXT_INSTALLATION}#activation`}>installation & activation guide</Link>.

The theme's source code can now be modified and saved changes will immediately apply to the currently running Sublime Text instance.

# Packaging

Sublime Text packages are stored as compressed `.sublime-package` file using the [ZIP][wiki-zip] archive file format. To create Nord as package, either add at least the [`Nord.sublime-color-scheme`][gh-tree-color_scheme] and [`Nord.skins`][gh-tree-skins] files (recommended) or the whole repository to a new ZIP archive file named `Nord.sublime-package`.

Read the theme documentation about <Link to={`${ROUTE_DOCS_PORTS_SUBLIME_TEXT_INSTALLATION}#manual`}>how to install and activate a `.sublime-theme` package file</Link> for more details.
