Nord Atom UI is designed to provide a good UX out-of-the-box, but there is a reason why principles like _themes_ exist at all: Everyone has different preferences and that's a good thing!

To ensure Nord Atom UI fit your needs it comes with configurations for UI elements to make the theme as flexible as possible while still providing sane defaults.

All theme configurations are available through the _Settings_ by switching to the _Themes_ pane and clicking on the small _gear_ icon button next to the _UI Theme_ drop-down component.

  dropShadow
  fluid={props.images["settings-theme-button.png"]}
  rounded
>
  <span>The icon button to show the UI theme specific configurations.</span>
</Image>

This will open the available configurations of the active UI theme.

## UI Elements

### Full-Width Tabs

By default, tabs are using a minimal width required to display the content like titles and allow to keep a better overview when having a large number of open tabs.

<Image alt="Screenshot showing Atom's default tab style" dropShadow fluid={props.images["full-width-tabs-disabled.png"]} rounded>
  <span>Default tab style.</span>
</Image>

This can be changed to use the full tab bar width, where the available size is evenly distributed among the open tabs, by enabling the „Full-Width Tab Sizing“ theme configuration.

<Image
  alt="Screenshot showing Atom with enabled „Full-Width Tab Sizing“ theme configuration"
  dropShadow
  fluid={props.images["full-width-tabs-enabled.png"]}
  rounded
>
  <span>Tabs with enabled „Full-Width Tab Sizing“ theme configuration.</span>
</Image>

### Darker Form Focus

By default, form components like a text field using bright styles when focused like a light background color with a dark foreground color to better emphasize the focus state of the currently active UI component.

<Video dropShadow loop poster={props.images["darker-form-focus-disabled.mp4.png"]} rounded sources={[props.videos["darker-form-focus-disabled.mp4"]]}>
  <span>Default bright form focusing effect.</span>
</Video>

This can be changed to use darker styles with `nord2` as background and `nord4` as foreground color by enabling the „Darker Form-Focusing Effect“ theme configuration.

<Video dropShadow loop poster={props.images["darker-form-focus-enabled.mp4.png"]} rounded sources={[props.videos["darker-form-focus-enabled.mp4"]]}>
  <span>Form focusing effect with enabled „Darker Form-Focusing Effect“ theme configuration.</span>
</Video>

</ShrinkedWidth>
