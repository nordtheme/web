[dircolors][gnu-docs-dircolors] is a utility that sets the `LS_COLORS` environment variable respected by [GNU `ls`][wiki-ls] when used with the `--color` option. It converts the _color database file_ provided by this theme (`dir_colors`), converts it into the parsable format for the GNU `ls` command and stores it in the `LS_COLOR` environment variable.

Other distributions/platforms/operating systems like [macOS][wiki-macos] are based on [BSD][wiki-bsd] and using a different implementation of the `ls` command that uses a different format for color definitions stored in the `LSCOLOR` environment variable (no underscore).

The `dircolors` utility only supports GNU `ls` and therefore this theme is also only compatible with the GNU `ls` command. It has no effect when used with different implementations.

Please read the [manual pages of the `dircolors(1)` utility][linux-man-dircolors] and its [configuration file `dir_colors(5)`][linux-man-dir_colors] for more information about supported terminal codes/sequences and platforms.

Nord dircolors provides highlighting for a lot of different data types, their attributes and file system permissions. This document contains a general overview of these types including descriptions about their applied Nord styles.

## Global Defaults

The following styles are applied globally to essential data and node types as well as their file system permissions.

### Permissions

The styles are applied for files and directories with different [file system permissions][wiki-fs_perm].

Directories using `nord9` as foreground color and a `bold` font style.
If the `t` permission flag is set the background color is `nord9` instead while `nord4` is used as foreground color using the `underline` font style. Also if the `o+w` permission flags are set too the font uses the `bold` style instead.

For directories with the `777` permission value both the `bold` and `underline` font styles are used.

### Links

The styles are applied for [symbolic][wiki-symlink] and [hard][wiki-hardlink] links using `nord8` as foreground color. Hard links additionally have a `underline` font style.

The foreground color of invalid symbolic links are colored by `nord11` while non-existent link targets using `nord11` as background color and `nord4` foreground with `bold` font styles.

### Executables

The styles are applied for [executables][wiki-exec] using `nord7` as foreground color with a `bold` font style.

### Blocks and Sockets

The styles are applied for [Unix file types][wiki-unix_ft] like [device files][wiki-dev_file] and [domain sockets][wiki-unix_sock].

Character device files are using `nord13` as foreground while block devices additionally having the `bold` font style. Sockets are also colored by `nord13` with a the `underline` font style.

### Capabilities

The styles are applied for files with different [capabilities][wiki-setuid].

The GID `g+s` and UID `u+s` capability flags are colored by `nord4` with the `bold` and `underline` font styles.

### Named Pipe (FIFO)

The styles are applied for [named pipe][wiki-named_pipe], also known as FIFO, using `nord7` as foreground color with the `underline` font style.

## Extension Pattern

The following styles are for files with specific file extensions.

### Media

Extension for media based types like images, audio, videos and documents are colored by `nord14` while archive- and compression types additionally using the `bold` font style.
