Nord consists of four named color palettes providing different syntactic meanings and color effects for dark & bright ambiance designs.

It has been created for **clear, uncluttered and elegant designs** following a **minimal and flat** style pattern.
For syntax highlighting it aims to ensure an **undisturbed focus on important parts of the code**, a **good readability** and a **quick visual distinction** between the different syntax elements.

All colors are numbered from `nord0` to `nord15` where each palette contains a different amount of colors. The naming convention preserves the compatibility for terminal color schemes and allows an uncomplicated use as base for such.

This document provides a set of guidelines detailing how to style and highlight code syntax and UI elements.
Please note that these guidelines are “soft“ recommendations to describe the original idea of Nord!
They may be used in a modified form like e.g. different use cases for a specific color or with different shading options applied.

> This is a _living document_ which means it is **work in progress**, not completed yet and **can change at any time** while the project is still in development!

<SpaceBox mTop={4} mBottom={4}>
  <ColorPaletteCard id="polar-night" colors={Object.values(palettes.POLAR_NIGHT)} floatingTitle="Polar Night" />
</SpaceBox>

**Polar Night** is made up of four darker colors that are commonly used for base elements like backgrounds or text color in _bright ambiance designs_.

### `nord0`

**The origin color of the _Polar Night_ palette.**

For _dark ambiance designs_, it is used for background and area coloring while not being used for syntax highlighting at all because otherwise it would collide with the same background color.

For _bright ambiance designs_, it is used for base elements like plain text, the text editor caret and reserved syntax characters like curly- and square brackets.
It is rarely used for passive UI elements like borders, but might be possible to achieve a higher contrast and better visual distinction (harder/not flat) between larger components.

### `nord1`

**A brighter shade color based on `nord0`.**

For _dark ambiance designs_ it is used for elevated, more prominent or focused UI elements like

- status bars and text editor gutters
- panels, modals and floating popups like notifications or auto completion
- user interaction/form components like buttons, text/select fields or checkboxes

It also works fine for more inconspicuous and passive elements like borders or as dropshadow between different components.
There's currently no official port project that makes use of it for syntax highlighting.

For _bright ambiance designs_, it is used for more subtle/inconspicuous UI text elements that do not need so much visual attention.
Other use cases are also state animations like a more brighter text color when a button is hovered, active or focused.

### `nord2`

**An even more brighter shade color of `nord0`.**

For _dark ambiance designs_, it is used to colorize the currently active text editor line as well as selection- and text highlighting color.
For both _bright & dark ambiance designs_ it can also be used as an brighter variant for the same target elements like `nord1`.

### `nord3`

**The brightest shade color based on `nord0`.**

For _dark ambiance designs_, it is used for UI elements like indent- and wrap guide marker.
In the context of code syntax highlighting it is used for comments and invisible/non-printable characters.

For _bright ambiance designs_, it is, next to `nord1` and `nord2` as darker variants, also used for the most subtle/inconspicuous UI text elements that do not need so much visual attention.

<SpaceBox mTop={4} mBottom={4}>
  <ColorPaletteCard id="snow-storm" colors={Object.values(palettes.SNOW_STORM)} floatingTitle="Snow Storm" />
</SpaceBox>

**Snow Storm** is made up of three bright colors that are commonly used for text colors or base UI elements in _bright ambiance designs_.

The palette can be used for two different shading ambiance styles:

- bright to dark — This is the **recommended style** that uses `nord6` as base color and highlights other UI elements with `nord5` and `nord4`.
- dark to bright (_semi-light_) — This style uses `nord4` as base color and highlights other UI elements with `nord5` and `nord6`.

The documentation of the different colors from this palette are based on the recommended _bright to dark_ ambiance style.
To apply the color purposes to the _dark to bright_ style the definitions can be used in reversed order.

### `nord4`

**The origin color of the _Snow Storm_ palette.**

For _dark ambiance designs_, it is used for UI elements like the text editor caret.
In the context of syntax highlighting it is used as text color for variables, constants, attributes and fields.

For _bright ambiance designs_, it is used for elevated, more prominent or focused UI elements like

- status bars and text editor gutters
- panels, modals and floating popups like notifications or auto completion
- user interaction/form components like buttons, text/select fields or checkboxes

It also works fine for more inconspicuous and passive elements like borders or as dropshadow between different components.
In the context of syntax highlighting it is not used at all.

### `nord5`

**A brighter shade color of `nord4`.**

For _dark ambiance designs_, it is used for more subtle/inconspicuous UI text elements that do not need so much visual attention.
Other use cases are also state animations like a more brighter text color when a button is hovered, active or focused.

For _bright ambiance designs_, it is used to colorize the currently active text editor line as well as selection- and text highlighting color.

### `nord6`

**The brightest shade color based on `nord4`.**

For _dark ambiance designs_, it is used for elevated UI text elements that require more visual attention.
In the context of syntax highlighting it is used as text color for plain text as well as reserved and structuring syntax characters like curly- and square brackets.

For _bright ambiance designs_, it is used as background and area coloring while not being used for syntax highlighting at all because otherwise it would collide with the same background color.

<SpaceBox mTop={4} mBottom={4}>
  <ColorPaletteCard id="frost" colors={Object.values(palettes.FROST)} floatingTitle="Frost" />
</SpaceBox>

**Frost** can be described as the heart palette of Nord, a group of four bluish colors that are commonly used for primary UI component and text highlighting and essential code syntax elements.

All colors of this palette are used the same for both _dark & bright ambiance designs_.

### `nord7`

**A calm and highly contrasted color reminiscent of frozen polar water.**

Used for UI elements that should, next to the primary accent color `nord8`, stand out and get more visual attention.
In the context of syntax highlighting it is used for classes, types and primitives.

### `nord8`

**The bright and shiny primary accent color reminiscent of pure and clear ice.**

Used for primary UI elements with main usage purposes that require the most visual attention.
In the context of syntax highlighting it is used for declarations, calls and execution statements of functions, methods and routines.

### `nord9`

**A more darkened and less saturated color reminiscent of arctic waters.**

Used for secondary UI elements that also require more visual attention than other elements.
In the context of syntax highlighting it is used for language specific, syntactic and reserved keywords as well as

- support characters
- operators
- tags
- units
- punctuations like (semi)colons, points and commas

### `nord10`

**A dark and intensive color reminiscent of the deep arctic ocean.**

Used for tertiary UI elements that require more visual attention than default elements.
In the context of syntax highlighting it is used for pragmas, comment keywords and pre-processor statements.

<SpaceBox mTop={4} mBottom={4}>
  <ColorPaletteCard id="aurora" colors={Object.values(palettes.AURORA)} floatingTitle="Aurora" />
</SpaceBox>

**Aurora** consists of five colorful components reminiscent of the [„Aurora borealis“][wiki-aurora], sometimes referred to as _polar lights_ or _northern lights_.

All colors of this palette are used the same for both _dark & bright ambiance designs_.

### `nord11`

Used for UI elements that are rendering error states like linter markers and the highlighting of Git `diff` deletions.
In the context of syntax highlighting it is used to override the highlighting of syntax elements that are detected as errors.

### `nord12`

Rarely used for UI elements, but it may indicate a more advanced or dangerous functionality.
In the context of syntax highlighting it is used for special syntax elements like annotations and decorators.

### `nord13`

Used for UI elements that are rendering warning states like linter markers and the highlighting of Git `diff` modifications.
In the context of syntax highlighting it is used to override the highlighting of syntax elements that are detected as warnings as well as escape characters and within regular expressions.

### `nord14`

Used for UI elements that are rendering success states and visualizations and the highlighting of Git `diff` additions.
In the context of syntax highlighting it is used as main color for strings of any type like double/single quoted or interpolated.

### `nord15`

Rarely used for UI elements, but it may indicate a more uncommon functionality.
In the context of syntax highlighting it is used as main color for numbers of any type like integers and floating point numbers.
