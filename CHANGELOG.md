This version mainly focused on the [sections of the community page][gh-115] to represent Nord's community chat channels as well as the content & knowledge bases.

## Features

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48676311-39475300-eb65-11e8-9654-16c24c1c9a94.png" width="12%"/></p>

The following issues are related to the [“Components” design concept][gh-63].

**Community Page Sections** — #115 ⇄ #116 (⊶ 5fb775c7)
↠ Implemented all community page sections including required dependencies, components and illustrations.
All sections follow the [“Responsive Web” design concept][gh-52] to adjust the rendered content based on the available width and provide an optimal UX on smaller viewports.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/51789079-bb677f80-2185-11e9-8069-782a098c3d50.png"/></p>

### Hero

The first section is the “hero” of the community page that renders a description about the page's purpose and an animated SVG component.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/51789084-bb677f80-2185-11e9-8f01-06d2d1b24b5a.png"/></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/51789085-bc001600-2185-11e9-8711-fc6c7a082405.png"/></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/51789098-da661180-2185-11e9-86af-cfafc58395f3.gif"/></p>

### Chats

The 2nd section is about Nord's community chats where each platform is represented as card rendered in a two-column grid layout. Each card contains the platforms official logo, colorized with colors of the respective brand guidelines, a short summary about the platform/service and a link component that'll forward to the community within the platform.
Next to the official main channel each platform also provides sub-channels for all port projects

As of now the following community chats of Nord are represented:

- Arctic Ice Studio's official community on [Spectrum][spectrum-ais]
- Nord's official [Keybase team chat][kb-chat-nord]
- Nord's official [Slack][slack-ais] workspace
- Nord's official [Discord][] space

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/51789080-bb677f80-2185-11e9-8c28-5d429bfa14e0.png"/></p>

### Content

The 3th and also currently last section presents platforms where the community can create content and ask questions for and about Nord. Next to the official documentation these content & knowledge bases are also powered by community.

Like the chat platforms in the previous section each platform/service is represented as card including the same information, rendered by the same components, and also structured in a two-column grid layout.
Next to this, each card includes the latest three items (questions, posts etc.) of the platform's community rendered as link component with the item's title and metadata like tags, the name of the author and the relative creation date/time.

As of now the following community platforms of Nord are represented:

- Latest questions from [Stack Overflow][stof-nord-tagged] tagged with `nord` or `nordtheme`
- Nord's official [/r/nordtheme][] subreddit

All data is fetched from the official REST APIs of the respective platform using [axios][gh-axios].
The processing of any date/time data is handled with [date-fns][gh-date-fns], a modern and more lightweight ES6+ library with tree-shaking support that'll be used project-wide for Nord Docs to handle any other date/time data like e.g. blog posts metadata.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/51789082-bb677f80-2185-11e9-99f3-5cb9387fcefa.png"/></p>

# 0.6.0

![Release Date: 2019-01-13](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release_Date-2019--01--13-88c0d0.svg?style=flat-square&colorA=4c566a) [![Project Board](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project_Board-0.6.0-88c0d0.svg?style=flat-square&colorA=4c566a&logo=github&logoColor=eceff4)](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-docs/projects/8) [![Milestone](https://img.shields.io/badge/Milestone-0.6.0-88c0d0.svg?style=flat-square&colorA=4c566a&logo=github&logoColor=eceff4)](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-docs/milestone/6)

This version focused on the [sections of the landing page][gh-112] including the new [`Button` core atom component][gh-110] that represents the `<button>` HTML element.

## Features

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48676311-39475300-eb65-11e8-9654-16c24c1c9a94.png" width="12%"/></p>

The following issues are related to the [“Components” design concept][gh-63].

**Core HTML Element Atom: “Button”** — #110 ⇄ #111 (⊶ 41ce16fa)
↠ Implemented the core atom `Button` that represents a [`<button>`][mdn-button] base HTML element. It can also render as [core atom `A`][gh-70] with `Button` styles when the `href` or `to` props are passed with an internal and external URL.

It provides multiple variations:

- `primary` — uses the primary color `nord8` for background/border/text colorization.
- `secondary` — uses the secondary color `nord9` for background/border/text colorization.
- `simple` — uses the _Snow Storm_ and _Polar Night_ palettes for background/border/text colorization.
- `subtle` — only colorizes the background on hover using the _Snow Storm_ and _Polar Night_ palettes for background/border/text colorization.

Next to variations there are additional props to toggle more styles:

- `dashed` — uses the `dashed` property for the CSS [`border-style`][mdn-css-bs] attribute.
- `ghost` — only uses a border instead of a background color.
- `outlined` — uses uses a border in addition to a background color.
- `quiet` — keeps the initial text colorization on hover.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50845511-50d4d800-136d-11e9-98cf-7906148ff0ef.gif" width="30%"/></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50845538-5fbb8a80-136d-11e9-84b0-b81d7d5c2e94.png" width="30%"/></p>

**Landing Page Sections** — #112 ⇄ #113 (⊶ 339d3b8f)
↠ Implemented the core atom `Button` that represents a [`<button>`][mdn-button] base HTML element. It can also render as [core atom `A`][gh-70] with `Button` styles when the `href` or `to` props are passed with an internal and external URL.

Implemented all landing page sections including required dependencies, components and illustrations.
All sections follow the [“Responsive Web” design concept][gh-52] to adjust the rendered content based on the available width and provide an optimal UX on smaller viewports.

### Hero

The first sections is the “hero” of the landing page that renders a short project description and the animated [Arctic Landscape][gh-arcland] SVG component. The animation will be triggered through the [React Waypoint][gh-rw] project.

### Color Palettes

The 2nd and 3rd sections are about Nord's color palettes and provide information about the modularity and contrast. All palettes are visualized through a new "color palette card" component that consists of the actual colors as small, rounded boxes and the associated color code as label using the hexadecimal format.

### “Nordify”

The 4th section presents Nord's port projects which can be used by users to “nordify” their favorite apps and platforms. It consists of the text content as well as a new illustration that might also be animated later on using a 3D parallax effect that reacts and moves based on the current mouse position in the section.

### Color Swatches

The 5th section is about Nord's “native” color swatches. It consists of the same elements like the 4th section, but renders a new non-animated illustration showing a application UI with Nord loaded as color palette.

### Syntax Highlighting

The 6th section is all about Nord's features to highlight code. Next to the text content and summary it renders a new and animated illustration, too.

### Community

The 7th and also last section presents details about Nord's communities. It renders the animated [Arctic Ocean Fractal][gh-arcocfrac] SVG component and a short summary about how to join, contribute and develop Nord's community.

## Bug Fixes

**Landing page decoration container blocks mouse pointer events** — #114 (⊶ 4ce828cb)
↠ Fixed the container for decoration components of the landing page (implemented in #112) blocking all mouse/pointer events since it covers the whole section size. Therefore all underlying elements like buttons and links couldn't be clicked/pressed because the pointer was focused on the decoration container.

# 0.5.0

![Release Date: 2018-12-29](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release_Date-2018--12--29-88c0d0.svg?style=flat-square&colorA=4c566a) [![Project Board](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project_Board-0.5.0-88c0d0.svg?style=flat-square&colorA=4c566a&logo=github&logoColor=eceff4)](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-docs/projects/7) [![Milestone](https://img.shields.io/badge/Milestone-0.5.0-88c0d0.svg?style=flat-square&colorA=4c566a&logo=github&logoColor=eceff4)](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-docs/milestone/5)

This version focused on the essential [footer][gh-106] as well as a styled [link component][gh-105]. It also includes the integration of the Webpack [size-plugin][gh-109] to print the gzipped sizes of assets and the changes since the last production build.

## Features

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48676311-39475300-eb65-11e8-9654-16c24c1c9a94.png" width="12%"/></p>

The following issues are related to the [“Components” design concept][gh-63].

**Core Atom: “Link”** — #105 ⇄ #107 (⊶ cf1f1184)
↠ Implemented the core atom `Link` that wraps the [base HTML element atom component the `A`][gh-70] and adds matching brand styles to it.

**Core Organism Component: “Footer”** — #106 ⇄ #108 (⊶ 9a6c0496)
↠ Implemented the core organism component `Footer` which represent the `<footer>` element and is an essential part of _Nord Docs_. It provides a sitemap, the Arctic Ice Studio organization branding logo and caption, networking & social media links as well as the copyright paragraph including version information.

### Layout

The footer uses a CSS [flexbox][mdn-flexbox] and [grid][mdn-grids] layout consisting of two container components with the maximum of flexible space between both. The left-side container contains the branding and link components while the right-side container contains the sitemap like documented in the sections below.

#### Wave Divider

For a nice and smooth transition between the last section/element of a page a new SVG vector graphic divider in form of multiple “overlapping waves” has been added. It must be rendered by the last component/element (in most cases a `Section`/`<section>`) to ensure the transparent background of the wave's container matches the last components background by rendering it in the bounds.

#### Sitemap

To allow users to simply navigate around the site, next to the main header, the component provides the quickly accessible sitemap. This container uses the [flexbox][mdn-flexbox] layout where each base route of the site is added as one category represented as a column. Each of these consists of an heading, the name of the route, and the corresponding sub-routes.

As of now the following base routes are included:

- “Nord” — links to `/` and includes all sections of the main landing page.
- “Ports” — links to `/ports` and includes all sections of the Nord port projects.
- “Docs” — links to `/docs` and includes all sections of Nord's documentation.
- “Blog” — links to `/blog` and includes all sections of Nord's blog.
- “Community” — links to `/community` and includes all sections of the Nord community channels.

#### Organization Branding

To represent Arctic Ice Studio's branding, the left-sided container contains the logo with the caption that'll link to the organization website. It is placed in one line with the category heading of the sitemap like documented in the section above.

#### Social Media & Networking Links

The left-side container also contains the social media & networking links where each link is represented through the icon of the corresponding site/service. They are placed in one line with a flexible layout to adust based on the available width.

#### Version Information

The last elements of the left-side container is a paragraph providing version information about the site like the currently running version (with _commits ahead_ metadata when required) and the build & deployment date. It also has additional Git metadata added as `data-` attributes and a `<time>` HTML element.

### Responsive Design

For reduced width views (responsive design) the footer adjusts several styles and composed components. For really small view ports the grid layout be switches to a flexbox layout.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50536175-ea241300-0b51-11e9-85d6-41350ce8017b.png" width="40%" /></p>

**Core Organism Component: “Footer”** — #109 (⊶ 75435d07)
↠ Integrated the Webpack [size-plugin][gh-sp] that prints the gzipped sizes of assets and the changes since the last build added through [gatsby-plugin-webpack-size][gh-gp-ws].

# 0.4.0

![Release Date: 2018-12-23](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release_Date-2018--12--23-88c0d0.svg?style=flat-square&colorA=4c566a) [![Project Board](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project_Board-0.4.0-88c0d0.svg?style=flat-square&colorA=4c566a&logo=github&logoColor=eceff4)](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-docs/projects/6) [![Milestone](https://img.shields.io/badge/Milestone-0.4.0-88c0d0.svg?style=flat-square&colorA=4c566a&logo=github&logoColor=eceff4)](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-docs/milestone/4)

This version focused on [analytics & statistics][gh-86] as well as [SEO & social media representation][gh-100]. This includes the integration of [Google Analytics][gh-87], requirements of a [PWA][gdev-web-pwa] ([Progressive Web App][wiki-pwa]) like a [Web App Manifest][gh-91], _offline_ resistance and availability through a [service worker][gh-94] and [improved caching strategies and usage of advanced techniques like HTTP/2 server push][gh-89].

Several implementation for SEO have been made with automated generation of web standard resources like the [sitemap.xml][gh-96] and [robots.txt][gh-98] files. A new [`SiteMetadata` component][gh-101] has been added to allow to provide metadata for several specifications like the [Open Graph Protocol][ogp], [Twitter Cards][tw-docs-cards] and [schema.org][].

## Features

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50167256-14bbd380-02e9-11e9-8aca-a31baf745cd8.png" width="12%" /></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50167593-c824c800-02e9-11e9-9b70-84b6fc40c05f.png " width="10%"/></p>

**Google Analytics** — #87 ⇄ #88 (⊶ 7aed8952)
↠ Integrated [Google Analytics][ga-mark] like documented in the [“Analytics & Statistics” design concept][gh-86] through the Gatsby plugin [gatsby-plugin-google-gtag][gh-gatsby-p-gtag].

It is a stable and proven service tool to collect and analyze data with a lot of useful configurable features and a reliable persistence.

_Nord Docs_ uses the latest and recommended [gtag.js][gdev-ga-gtag] library that optionally allows, next to Google Analytics itself, the integration of almost all Google Marketing services like e.g. [Google Tag Manager][gdev-tm].

To protect the privacy of users and to be compatible with various privacy and data legal guidelines all [IP addresses are anonymized][gsup-ga-anonip].

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48661237-35d1a000-ea6f-11e8-8e16-f48948969be6.png" width="12%" /></p>

**Gatsby Plugin "Netlify"** — #89 ⇄ #90 (⊶ b4a91fd9)
↠ Added [gatsby-plugin-netlify][npm-gatsby-plugin-netlify] to automatically generate a `_headers` file and a `_redirects` file at the root of the public folder to configure [HTTP headers][netlify-docs-headers] and [redirects][netlify-docs-rd] on Netlify.
One of the main advantages is that it also enables HTTP/2 server push of critical Gatsby assets through the `Link` headers. By default, the plugin adds HTTP/2 assets to server push the critical Gatsby scripts (ones that have the `preload` attribute already) and additionally adds basic security and caching headers.

See the [“Hosting & Continuous Deployment” design concept][gh-46] for more details.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50234314-aee94d80-03b5-11e9-8eda-e56b9b632b22.png" width="12%" /></p>

**Gatsby Plugin "Web App Manifest"** — #91 ⇄ #93 (⊶ 6415ddc5)
↠ Integrated [gatsby-plugin-manifest][npm-gatsby-plugin-manifest] that adds support for generating and shipping a [web app (PWA) `manifest.webmanifest`][mdn-web-mf]. It allows users to save _Nord Docs_ as web application to their desktops / task bars and smartphone home screens so it behaves similar to native apps.

See the great Google Developer documentation about [the web app manifest][gdev-fund-wamf] and the [official W3 Web App Manifest specification][w3-spec-mf].

Note that it is **recommended to use this plugin together with** [gatsby-plugin-offline][npm-gatsby-plugin-offline] ([#94][gh-94]), but ensure that **this plugin is listed before the offline plugin** so that it can cache the created `manifest.webmanifest` file!

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50229928-b86db800-03ab-11e9-89ad-07075d659574.png" width="12%" /></p>

**Gatsby Plugin "Offline" Service Worker** — #94 ⇄ #95 (⊶ e381f366)
↠ Integrated [gatsby-plugin-offline][gh-gatsby-p-offline] that adds drop-in support for making a Gatsby site work offline and more resistant to bad network connections. It creates a service worker for the site using the great [Workbox][] project and loads the service worker into the client.

Note that it is **recommended to use this plugin together with** [gatsby-plugin-manifest][gh-gatsby-p-manifest] ([#91][gh-94]), but ensure that **this plugin is listed after the offline plugin** so that the created `manifest.webmanifest` file can be included in the service worker!

The plugin comes with optimal configurations out-of-the-box™. Note that the offline support can break when changing these options.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50330182-920a6280-04fa-11e9-825d-157168c2eb93.png" width="12%" /></p>

**Gatsby Plugin "Sitemap"** — #96 ⇄ #97 (⊶ 1cf69f42)
↠ Integrated [gatsby-plugin-sitemap][gh-gatsby-p-sitemap] that automatically generates a [sitemap.xml][wiki-sitemap] file including all of _Nord Docs_ pages, except the ones excluded by default and custom configured routes.

Note that by default the plugin assumes that the default Gatsby config object field `siteMetadata.siteUrl` is set to the site's URL.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50345701-4ecae680-0530-11e9-9cff-7b42a99dd673.png" width="12%" /></p>

**Gatsby Plugin "robots.txt"** — #98 ⇄ #99 (⊶ ca4ed675)
↠ Integrated [gatsby-plugin-robots-txt][gh-gatsby-p-robots-txt] that automatically generates a [robots.txt][wiki-robotstxt] file.

Note that by default the plugin assumes that the default Gatsby config object field `siteMetadata.siteUrl` is used and set to the site's URL. It also uses the default path `${siteMetadata.siteUrl/sitemap.xml}` for the sitemap file ([#96][gh-96]).

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50351078-59da4280-0541-11e9-97ec-b983c43bbedc.png" width="12%" /> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50351088-6199e700-0541-11e9-831d-0b9200abfbe9.png" width="12%" /></p>

**Site Metadata Component** — #101 ⇄ #102 (⊶ a8fb8edd)
↠ Implemented the core atom `SiteMetadata` that injects global metadata. Next to general data like the page title and canonical URL it will include data for the [Open Graph Protocol][ogp], [Twitter Cards][tw-docs-cards] and the [schema.org][] structured data format [JSON-LD][].
The component doesn't render any UI, but injects the elements into the `<head>` using [React Helmet][gh-react-helmet].

For more details read the [“SEO & Social Media Representation” design concept][gh-100] and the great documentation about [SEO with Gatsby][gatsby-docs-seo].

## Tasks

**Dependency Update December 2018** — #103 ⇄ #104 (⊶ 1c4ba796)
↠ Performed the regular batch update for outdated dependencies which raises React to version [16.7.0][react-rln-16.7.0] to include an important performance bug fix for `React.lazy`.

Babel has been updated to the latest minor version [7.2.0][babel-rln-7.2.0] (including official plugins) that comes with a lot of improvements and bug fixes for TypeScript and Flow as well as support for _private instance methods_ and “smart” pipeline operator parsing.

The `babel-plugin-styled-components` plugin now also supports the new `css` prop of the also updated `styled-components` package.

Gatsby and all plugins have been updated to the latest versions to include the latest improvements and bug fixes.

Note that packages marked with an :exclamation: have been affected by the security incident!

This version focused on the [responsive web design][gh-52], [core & base component][gh-63] as well as [base HTML elements as components][gh-69] of _Nord Docs_. It includes the [base layout][gh-66] which initially consists of the [header][gh-64] that provides the global navigation links.
Another focus was the handling of exceptional & special states like [empty states][gh-78] and the [404 error state][gh-84].

## Features

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/49325616-f1053900-f545-11e8-9725-0b8f5af8d1e2.png" width="12%" /></p>

**Base Media Query Setup** — #61 ⇄ #62 (⊶ 6b78d691)
↠ The basic setup for components with responsive styles through media queries has been implemented based on the [“Responsive Web Design” design concept][gh-52].

### Media Query Generator

To simplify the usage of [media queries][mdn-mq] with [styled-components][gh-51], a utility function to generate [media templates][stc-docs-mqt]has been implemented. It uses the `min-width` parameter to fulfill the used _mobile-first_ approach. The base size that is used has been implemented as theme property in [#54][gh-55-diff-r49].

### Initial Media Queries

> Always adjust media queries to the content individually and not vice-versa.
> The design supports the content. Not the other way around.

Like documented in the #52, _Nord Docs_ uses the _mobile-first_ pattern and follows the great [“Google Developer Responsive Web Design” guidelines][gdev-web-fund-rwd]. The recommended way is to create media queries not based on any device sizes but individually based on the content which is unique for each project. This is the best practice and, contrary to most popular CSS framework like Bootstrap, the correct way since each site is different and there are thousands of devices and in the future new sizes will appear.
The following media query template functions have been implemented:

- `phonePortrait` — `max-width: 479px`
- `phoneLandscape` — `max-width: 480px`
- `tabletPortrait` — `max-width: 600px`
- `tabletLandscape` — `max-width: 900px`
- `desktop` — `max-width: 1200px`
- `desktopPlus` — `max-width: 1800px`

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48676311-39475300-eb65-11e8-9654-16c24c1c9a94.png" width="15%"/></p>

**Core Layout Component: BaseLayout** — #66 ⇄ #68 (⊶ 208c9ac0)
↠ Implemented the `BaseLayout` core layout component, the default layout of _Nord Docs_. It consists of the [`Root` core container][gh-36] as root element and the core components representing the [header][gh-64], the main [page container][gh-65] and in the future the _footer_.

**Core Container Component: Page** — #65 ⇄ #67 (⊶ 701ec43d)
↠ Implemented the core container component `Page`, the base wrapper for page content of _Nord Docs_. It renders the [HTML `<main>` element][mdn-html-el-main] to wrap page content and is used in layout components like [`BaseLayout`][gh-66].

**Core Atom HTML Element: P** — #79 ⇄ #80 (⊶ ad995b0a)
↠ Implemented the core atom `P` that represents the [text content][mdn-html-el-tc] HTML element [`<p>`][mdn-html-el-p]. It uses adjusted styles instead of browser defaults to match _Nord Docs_ brand style.

**Core Atom HTML Element: Heading** — #81 ⇄ #82 (⊶ c4e1aa84)
↠ Implemented the core atoms `H1`-`H6` that represent the [content sectioning][mdn-html-el-cs] HTML elements [`<h1>`-`<h6>`][mdn-html-el-h]. They use custom styles instead of browser defaults and allow to disable the bottom margin via the `noMargin` prop. The font style like size, modular scale and family adhere to the [“Typography” design concept][gh-2].

**Core Atom HTML Element: A** — #70 ⇄ #71 (⊶ 75d0e49c)
↠ Implemented the core atom `A` that represents the [inline text semantic][mdn-html-el-inl-txt-sem] HTML element [`<a>`][mdn-html-el-a]. This is a special dynamic and _failsafe_ component because it internally uses the [Gatsby `Link`][gatsby-docs-link] component to route within the site (internal links) while also being able to link to external data.

### URL Routing Utilities

To handle the logic of conditionally rendering a Gatsby `Link` or a basic `<a>`, based on the passed target URL (internal & external), utility functions has been implemented to evaluate the passed target.

**Core Organism Component: Header** — #64 ⇄ #75 (⊶ d6f0fef2)
↠ Implemented the essential core organism component `Header` that provides the main site navigation and a user action component to [toggle between the global theme modes][gh-57].

### Layout

The header uses the CSS _flexbox_ layout consisting of two container components with the maximum of flexible space between both. The containers contain the branding and the navigation components like described in the sections below.

### Navigation

To allow users to simply navigate around the site, the component provides the quickly accessible navigation. It is placed in the right-sided container and currently contains the following items:

- “Ports” — links to `/ports`, the landing page for all Nord port projects.
- “Docs” — links to `/docs`, the landing page for Nord's documentation.
- “Blog” — links to `/blog`, the landing page for Nord's blog.
- “Community” — links to `/community`, the landing page of the Nord community channels.

### Branding

To represent Nord's branding, the left-sided container contains the Nord logo with the caption. It links the landing page to allow quick access to the root (`/`) page.

### Theme Mode Switcher

The user action component mentioned in the introduction paragraph above allows to toggle between the available global theme modes. Both modes are represented through icons where a sun is used for the “bright snow flurry” and a moon for the “dark night frost” mode. They are implemented using the awesome [React Pose][react-pose] project to animate the switching. The icons “fly out and in” within the bounds of the component that takes the form of a button.

Like documented in the [“Iconography” design concept][gh-74], the awesome [Eva Icons][eva-icons] project is for icons.

### Responsive Design

For reduced width views (responsive design) the header adjusts several styles and composed components.

#### Slide Menu

The main navigation link list will be hidden and replaced by a user action element (button) that toggles an animated slide down menu containing the navigation links. The drop down starts right below the header and takes up the available height and width to cover the full screen. As soon as the animation starts all scroll events will be removed from the underlying content (body) using the [body-scroll-lock][gh-bsl] project. This prevents users from scrolling the content below the menu when the menu itself overflows the Y-axis and shows a scroll bar.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/49829535-fc026980-fd8e-11e8-9cba-d5d6e8149c10.png" width="15%"/></p>

### Behavior

To allow quick access while also being inconspicuous, the component is _sticky_ at the top of the site, but collapses as soon as the user scrolls down and only switches back into expanded mode when at top of the site.
In expanded mode, the height of the header is larger and the caption of the logo is visible. As soon as switching into collapsed mode the height decreases and the logo caption fades out with a smooth transition animation.

To achieve the resizing animation based on the scroll position the [subscribe-ui-event][gh-sue] project is used to listen to scroll events. It provides throttling by default, only calls `document.body.scrollTop` and `window.innerWidth` once and uses `requestAnimationFrame` for a better performance.

**Empty State Component** — #78 ⇄ #83 (⊶ 2079c056)
↠ Implemented the `EmptyState` molecule component to represent an [empty state][md-com-es]. It consists an vector illustration, a headline and the corresponding subline.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50157534-f696a900-02d1-11e9-9d04-80a813da9e6c.png" width="12%"/></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50157551-0615f200-02d2-11e9-898f-611ebd20621e.png" width="12%"/></p>

There are initially 3 different illustrations available that can be selected through the `illustrationVariant` prop. The headline informs the user about the purpose of the illustration and the reason why it is currently shown while the subline can include additional information and helpful instructions.

The empty state component has been placed within a base HTML component that represents a [`<section>`][mdn-html-el-sec] with multiple base style variants and is now initially used by the new base page components for the [header navigation links][gh-64].

**404 Page Components** — #84 ⇄ #85 (⊶ a39649fa)
↠ Implemented the [404][wiki-404] page and illustration components to handle requested but non-existing routes and resources.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/50157486-d23acc80-02d1-11e9-9ed9-628174d012c9.png" width="15%"/></p>

It aligns with _Nord Docs_ brand and can use a humorous image and tagline that conveys the purpose of the screen, without appearing actionable.
Also see the [great Gatsby documentation about 404 pages][gatsby-docs-404] for more details.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/49604267-bceaa780-f98d-11e8-932a-05ee4b952a83.png" width="15%" /></p>

**SVGR Integration** — #72 ⇄ #73 (⊶ 39c13041)
↠ Integrated [SVGR][], a transformer for SVG into ready to use React components. It is part of [create-react-app][cra] and makes SVG integration into React projects easy.

All configurations are placed in the `svgr.config.js` file instead of passing them to the corresponding Gatsby plugin for the Webpack loader that is described in the section below.

### Webpack Loader

To directly import SVG's as React component the [@svgr/webpack][gh-svgr-wpl] package is used to simply integrate SVGR as Webpack plugin. It has been added through [gatsby-plugin-svgr][npm-gp-svgr] which adjusts the required Webpack configurations by adding the loader and removing the default `.svg` file loader/handler.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48661206-c0fe6600-ea6e-11e8-8142-4c65c82b9927.png" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48837384-7ab64900-ed85-11e8-829c-3fd6efe86c60.png" width="15%"/></p>

**Jest utilities for Styled Components** — #76 ⇄ #77 (⊶ 47010b8c)
↠ Integrated [jest-styled-components][gh-jsc], a set of utilities for testing [Styled Components][styled-components] with [Jest][] that improves the snapshot testing experience and provides a brand new matcher to make expectations on the style rules.
Instead of storing the generated class names in snapshots it allows to track the actual CSS rules and attributes for **better comparison what changed** and **if the change is even really related to the affected component**.

This is the officially [recommended library to use Jest with styled-components][stc-docs-tooling-jest].

```js
const Button = styled.button`
  color: red;
`;
```

```js
exports[`snapshot`] = `
<button
  className="sc-bdVaJa rOCEJ"
/>
`;
```

**Before**

```diff
- Snapshot
+ Received

 <button
-  className="sc-bdVaJa rOCEJ"
+  className="sc-bdVaJa hUzqNt"
 />
```

**After**

```diff
- Snapshot
+ Received

+.c0 {
+  color: green;
+}
+
 <button
-  className="sc-bdVaJa rOCEJ"
+  className="c0"
 />
```

The package has been added in the setup file defined in Jest's `setupTestFrameworkScriptFile` field (#39) to enable all included features.

### Custom Style Matcher

The [custom `toHaveStyleRule` matcher][gh-jsc-matcher] is useful to test if a given rule is applied to a component. It is added to the extended global `except` object when the main package file is being imported.

This version focused on the [typography][gh-2], the [brand design & styling][gh-51] and _theme modes_ of _Nord Docs_. It includes the globally used [typefaces][gh-54], a React context [provider and consumer component for the available theme modes][gh-57] as well as some initial [global base styles][gh-59].

## Features

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48346100-5e762600-e67a-11e8-8f9d-86a633c69043.png" width="60%" /></p>

**Typefaces** — #54 ⇄ #55 (⊶ 81a5b238)
↠ Integrated globally available open source typefaces like documented in the [“Typograhpy” design concept][gh-2] and implemented the `typography` module to define style properties and configurations. The font size and units are based on the used [modular scale][modularscale-majorsecond] documented in #2.

[Rubik][gf-rubik] — the main stylistic and visualization sans-serif font installed through through the [typeface-rubik][npm-typeface-rubik] package.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/49332499-28a7cb80-f5ae-11e8-976f-8dc2bbabaf94.png" width="60%"/></p>

[Inter UI][inter-ui] — the sans-serif font for documentations as well as technical and factual content. It is installed through the [inter-ui][npm-inter-ui] package. Note that the font is currently not available through [Google Fonts][gf] yet, but might be added in the future very soon due to its large popularity and perfect implementation.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/49332633-e9c74500-f5b0-11e8-9690-2f473df739ba.png" width="60%"/></p>

**Base Style & Theme Setup** — #53 ⇄ #56 (⊶ 85498ca0)
↠ Implemented the basic style & theme setup like documented in the [“Brand Design & Styling” design concept][gh-51] using the CSS-in-JS library [styled-components][] for component representations. To use uniform global theme definitions and to simplify CSS styling, the [styled-theming][gh-styled-theming] and [polished][] libraries are also integrated next to some useful and required specific Babel & Gatsby plugins.

##### Default Browser Style Normalization

Integrated the great project [modern-normalize][gh-modern-normalize] that normalizes the default styles of browsers for a consistent appearance across different modern browsers. For the best usage with _styled-components_ the [npm-styled-modern-normalize][npm-styled-modern-normalize] project is used. It exports the styles via the `css` API and has been added to the created global styles component mentioned below.

##### CSS Tools

To simplify the CSS styling, the [polished][] package is used that provides a lightweight toolset for writing styles in JavaScript (CSS-in-JS).

##### CSS Base Styles

Global and normalization CSS styles have been implemented using _styled-components_ `css` API. They extend _modern-normalize_ and define, next to the browser normalization, styles of the available global themes like documented in the sections below.

In order to use fonts in _Nord Docs_ style & themes (implemented in #54) the basic properties and values have been added and integrated into this CSS base styles.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48661206-c0fe6600-ea6e-11e8-8142-4c65c82b9927.png" /></p>

##### Global Styles

To inject global styles, _styled-components_ v4 [`createGlobalStyle`][stc-docs-api-cgs] API is used to create a `<GlobalStyle>` component to inject various styles globally.

##### Global Themes

To [provide the global theme][stc-docs-theming], the [`ThemeProvider`][stc-docs-api-thp] component has been added to the _Nord Docs_ [`Root` core container component][gh-36]. The global theme is now passed to the provider.

##### Simplified Theme Usage

To simplify the usage of _styled-theming's_ [`theme()`][gh-stth-api-th] and `theme.variants()` API functions, two utility functions have been implemented:

- `themeMode(modeStyles : object)` — Shorthand function for the `theme` API to define styles based on the global theme mode(s).
- `themedModeVariant(modeStyles : object, variantPropName : string)` — Shorthand function for the `theme.variants` API to define variant styles based on the global theme mode(s).

##### Available Themes

Initially _Nord Docs_ will be build with the “bright snow flurry” and “dark night frost” _theme modes_. The names have been implemented as constants with values `BRIGHT_SNOW_FLURRY` and `DARK_NIGHT_FROST` that are used with the utility functions mentioned above to define the styles of a component for each available global theme.

##### Plugins

[_styled-components_ great Babel plugin][stc-docs-tool-babel] adds support for server-side rendering, minification of styles, and a nicer debugging experience. It has been integrated via the [corresponding Gatsby's plugin][npm-gatsby-plugin-styled-components].

##### Nord Colors

Since the main [JavaScript implementation of Nord][gh-nord-36] is currently not completed and released yet, the colors and palettes have been provided "manually" via the `nord` and `palettes` modules. As soon as the implementation has been done they will be replaced through imports from the official package.

##### Motion

Some basic configurations for motion related styles like animations have been implemented, inspired by [Material Designs][md] great documentation and guide about [motion speed][md-motion-speed]. This includes values for speed like transition durations for the global theme modes. It'll be used to set the CSS transition for the base background and font color within the `globals` CSS style module.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/49328407-a4832300-f570-11e8-8613-21c78267b558.png" width="20%" /></p>

**Theme Mode Context** — #57 ⇄ #58 (⊶ 86edb920)
↠ Implemented a [`React.Context` provider and consumer][react-docs-context] for the global theme modes. It provides the name of the currently active theme and a function to toggle through available themes.

##### Context Provider & Consumer

Both the context consumer and provider components have been implemented in the [`Root` core container component][gh-36]. The consumer is exported and can then be imported in any component to consume the provided values.

The `Root` component has beene changed from a SFC to a class component to store the currently active state and handle the theme mode toggle logic through a function. It migrated the currently used simple [styled-component theme][stc-docs-theming] (provided through the `<ThemeProvider` component) to the [styled-theming theme][gh-styled-theming] that provides the initially implemented theme (#53).

##### Session Storage

To persist the current active theme mode when changing the route (which unmounts the `Root` component and therefore resets the state), the value is written to the browser's [session storage][mdn-ss]. The storage type has been preferred over the [local storage][mdn-ls] since this would persist the active theme mode even when the user closes the tab, but the desired behavior is to optimize the site for the “bright snow flurry” aura theme mode that is set as default theme.

To simplify the read- and write handling as well as prevent possible errors due to wrong storage keys, two utility functions have also been implemented:

- `readSessionCache(key : string)` — Reads the value of the given key from the session storage (if available).
- `writeSessionCache(key : string, value : any)` — Writes the given key-value pair to the session storage (if available).

**Theme Global Base Styles** — #59 ⇄ #60 (⊶ 2c545da1)
↠ Implemented some basic theme styles like font and background colors. They are initially used in the global theme styles implemented in #53. This includes a transition for both attributes (`background-color` and `color`) to ensure a smooth theme mode transition.

# 0.1.0

This is the initial release version of _Nord Docs_.
It represents the basic project setup, structure and development workflow with an deployable state. There are many initial implementations and configurations for the documented design concepts. They are covered in the following sections of this version changelog to introduce used technologies and explain why several decisions have been made.

To get an overview of the general project plan, read the [“Design Concept & Initial Launch Plan”][gh-1] documentation which describes the project's justification, it's goals, the architecture, the tech stack and the “UI Design & Branding“ concept.

## Features

### Basic Project Setup

<p align="center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Npm-logo.svg?sanitize=true" width="100" /></p>

**NPM configuration file** — #4 (⊶ f4df27cb)
↠ Added the [NPM `.npmrc` file][npm-docs-rc] to ensure specific configurations are set project-wide for all core team members and contributors. This includes the usage of the [lockfile][npm-docs-lock] and exact (dev)dependency package versions.

<p align="center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Git-logo.svg" width="100" /></p>

**Git mail mapping** — #9 (⊶ e5629109)
↠ Added a Git [mailmap][git-docs-mailmap] file to link to in documentations and allow contributors to send mails regarding security issues. This prevents unnecessary overhead of updating all documents when new core team and members and contributors are added and additionally adds the main functionality of the file: Mapping commits when someone uses a different email address.

<p align="center"><img src="https://editorconfig.org/logo.png" width="100" /></p>

**EditorConfig** — #11 (⊶ 4fa30ce4)
↠ Added the [EditorConfig][] file to define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48669288-c5c02a00-eb01-11e8-8dc9-00142b4abce1.png" width="200" /></p>

### Design Concept: JAMstack

The following sections include details about implemented requirements for the three key criteria of the [“JAMstack” design concept][gh-24].

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74381/34074079-93ac0420-e25c-11e7-9c0a-642986b2aa58.png" width="200"/></p>

The [“Gatsby” design concept][gh-25] defines process steps and aspects for the static site generator that is used to build _Nord Docs_ like the Gatsby core configuration, Gatsby API implementations, required Gatsby plugins, custom configurations for [Babel][] and [Webpack][] and many more.

**Gatsby initial configuration** — #27 ⇄ #28 (⊶ 3cda2621)
↠ Initially implemented the [core configuration of Gatsby][gatsby-docs-config] through the `gatsby-config.js` file. It defines project-wide site metadata that can be used through the GraphQL API and configures all used plugins.

Read #27 for more details about the configuration and setup as well as included plugins. There have also been some tickets for bug fixe

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48694124-c3ca9980-ebdb-11e8-9cc3-1379d9ed4a20.png" width="100"/></p>

**Babel configuration** — #29 ⇄ #30 (⊶ b288befb)
↠ Implemented the configuration for [Babel][] even when Gatsby comes with an already optimized setup to create SSR “static” websites and apps, but there are also use cases that require to modify and extend this configuration to e.g. add a new Babel [plugin for the latest syntax feature/proposal][babel-docs-plug] support.

Read #29 for more details about the configuration and setup as well as included plugins.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48711809-761a5500-ec0c-11e8-8ba7-dc4acbd5d64c.png" width="100"/></p>

**Webpack configuration** — #31 ⇄ #32 (⊶ 7734d052)
↠ Implemented the configuration for [Webpack][] to add useful production bundle plugins and development workflow optimizations by using Gatsby's [Node API][gatsby-docs-api-node].

Read #31 for more details about the configuration and setup as well as included plugins.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48669377-c0fc7580-eb03-11e8-82e8-4853fb0ed52c.png" width="100" /></p>

**Introduce React** — #33 (⊶ 24aecae9)
↠ Initially added [React's][react] currently latest stable [version 16.6.3][npm-react-v16.6.3]. Since Gatsby v2, [React][npm-react] and [React DOM][npm-react-dom] are a peer dependencies which allows users to freely choose the version they'd like to use.

**Introduce React “prop-types”** — #35 (⊶ 4fe54731)
↠ To support type validation and checking, _Nord Docs_ initially uses [React prop types][react-docs-typecheck-pt] through the [prop-types][npm-prop-types] package. This technique is sufficient for the beginning of the project and might be revised and refactored later on by migrating to [TypeScript][] or integrating [Flow][].

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48676311-39475300-eb65-11e8-9654-16c24c1c9a94.png" width="100"/></p>

### Design Concept: Component & Project Structure

The following sections include details about implemented requirements for the [“Component & Project Structure” design concept][gh-26].

**Implemented the `Root` core container component (data provider)** — #36 ⇄ #37 (⊶ 0465f375)
↠ The `Root` core container is the first and one of the important main data provider React components of this project. It represents the base element and entry point that wraps the all custom application components and serves as a data provider later on. Some of the tasks in the future will be to

- provide context _props_ and functions for the global [styled-components][] theme through the [`ThemeProvider`][stc-docs-thprov] component
- inject global styles through _styled-components_ [`createglobalstyle`][stc-docs-globstyle] function including typography (#2) related data like application-wide used fonts
- possibly data stores for state management libraries like [MobX][]

This initial implementation only renders a `React.Fragment`.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48822935-24ceaa80-ed5f-11e8-8328-eec53dfc68f9.png" width="100"/></p>

### Design Concept: Testing

The following sections include details about implemented requirements for the [“Testing” design concept][gh-38].

**Set up the basic testing setup** — #39 ⇄ #42 (⊶ 7a4d356c)
↠ To start writing tests the basic testing environment has been set up. This includes the [Gatsby specific configurations][gatsby-docs-testing], the base setup for [Jest][] as well as the fantastic [react-testing-library][gh-rtl] and [just-dom's custom matchers][gh-jest-dom-matcher].

Read #39 for more details about the configuration and setup as well as included plugins.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48966346-26eb7000-efd0-11e8-818b-80035dd538ca.png" width="100"/></p>

### Design Concept: Continuous Integration & Testing

The following sections include details about implemented requirements of the workflow for the [“Continuous Integration & Testing” design concept][gh-43].

**Basic continuous integration & testing setup** — #44 ⇄ #45 (⊶ 2d0000e3)
↠ To ensure a great project quality, the stable and proven continuous integration & testing providers [Circle CI][circleci] and [Codecov][] have been set up to automate the CI process pipelines and provide code coverage reports.

Read #44 for more details about the configuration and setup as well as available automated pipelines.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/48661237-35d1a000-ea6f-11e8-8e16-f48948969be6.png" width="100" /></p>

### Design Concept: Hosting & Continuous Deployment

The following sections include details about implemented requirements of the workflow for the [“Hosting & Continuous Deployment” design concept][gh-46].

**Basic [Netlify][] configuration** — #48 (⊶ f03dc824)
↠ Implemented [Netlify's configuration file][netlify-docs-toml-ref] to define the `command` and `publish` path for production builds.

Read #48 and the design concept for more details about the configuration and setup as well as automated deployment pipelines.

## Bug Fixes

**Added missing “React Helmet” dependency** — #34 (⊶ b63bab36)
↠ Implemented the configuration for [Babel][] even when Gatsby comes with an already optimized setup to create SSR “static” websites and apps, but there are also use cases that require to modify and extend this configuration to e.g. add a new Babel [plugin for the latest syntax feature/proposal][babel-docs-plug] support.

During the initial implementation of Gatsby (#27) the [gatsby-plugin-react-helmet][npm-gatsby-plugin-react-helmet] has been added, but the required [react-helmet][npm-react-helmet] main package was accidentally forgotten to be added too.

**Fix invalid Webpack resolve alias for `pages`** — #40 (⊶ d2e72e39)
↠ Fixed the [Webpack resolve alias][webpack-docs-resv-alias] `pages` for Gatsby pages that was configured to the invalid `src/components/pages` path instead of the correct `src/pages` path.

**Fixed overridden ESLint `import/no-extraneous-dependencies` rule** — #41 (⊶ 7eccff4b)
↠ The [import/no-extraneous-dependencies][eslint-r-import/no-extraneous-dependencies] rule allows to define a array of glob pattern that are allowed to define import `devDependencies`. In #15 the rule was overridden to include the project specific path `**/.gatsby/**` which whitelists all Gatsby specific scripts. Unfortunately this removed all glob pattern defined in the used [eslint-config-arcticicestudio][npm-eslint-config-arcticicestudio] (rule is defined in the `-base` package) resulting in errors in other projects paths like tests.
It has been fixed by importing the paths defined in the preset from the [eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base][npm-eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base] package and merge it with the additional `**/.gatsby/**` path.

## Tasks

<p align="center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Npm-logo.svg?sanitize=true" width="100" /></p>

**NPM package initialization** — #3 (⊶ ff99b861)
↠ Initialized the [NPM `package.json` file][npm-docs-pkg] that contains the project's metadata and dependency definitions.

**Dependency update including security incident** — #47 (⊶ 43204f06)
↠ Performed the first regular batch update for outdated dependencies that includes an important update since it for the hijacked package [event-stream][npm-event-stream] that [includes malicious code which has been revealed yesterday][snyk-blog-malicious-event-stream]. _Nord Docs_ was affected passively because the package was a traverse dependency of the used package [npm-run-all][npm-npm-run-all]. The maintainer has reacted quickly and released the fix version [4.1.5][gh-npm-run-all-rln-4.1.5].

Note that packages marked with an double exclamation mark `‼` have been affected by the security incident!

↠ Added the [`.gitattributes`][git-docs-gitattributes] and [`.gitignore`][git-docs-gitignore] configuration files to define the pattern.

**Using `binary` Git attribute for “Adobe Illustrator” artwork project files** — #50 (⊶ f524be00)
↠ [“Adobe Illustrator“][wikip-ai] `.ai` artwork project files have been changed to be handled with the `binary` Git attribute instead of “normal” plain text to prevent encoding problems and noisy diff views.
